                    <p>Protected areas, designated to conserve biodiversity and natural heritage, face a myriad of issues that threaten their integrity and effectiveness. Despite their critical role in preserving ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity, these areas are increasingly challenged by external pressures such as illegal logging, poaching, climate change, and encroachment through agriculture and urban development. Furthermore, internal challenges such as insufficient funding, inadequate management, and conflicts with local communities over land use rights and resource access exacerbate the situation. As the global community strives towards conservation goals, understanding and addressing these issues is paramount for the sustainability and resilience of protected areas worldwide.</p>

                            <p>Soil biodiversity drives the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles upon which life on earth depends. The productivity of land is therefore determined by its soil biodiversity. However, current land degradation, chiefly due to chemical-fuelled, intensive agricultural production, is causing the loss of soil biodiversity.<br>(Read more)</p>
